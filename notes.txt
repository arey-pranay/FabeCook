*Creating a backend*

npm init
npm i express 

create server.js 
require express and assign it to app
call app.listen(port_num,func(){})
add a route by app.get("/contact",(req,res)=>{res.send("Somethingg")}) 

run node server.js

To avoid restarting server again and again to see your changes, npm i nodemon
Go to package.json and inside scripts, replace your test line with :     "server": "nodemon server.js"
Then nodemon start server to run the server with nodemon


*CORS*
Cross-origin resource sharing
It is used to configure which client is and which client is not allowed the access the server 
If the client is not allowed according to your CORS, it adds a header file in your response telling the browser that the request should be blocked or not.

npm i cors
const cors = require("cors")


*Postman*

Create a new collection
Add a request into that collection on your address like http://localhost:8000
The upper half is for req and the lower half is for res. View the Header in the res.

When you add app.use(cors());, you can see Access-Control-Allow-Origin *
When you use const options = {origin:"http://localhost:3000"} and app.use(cors(options)), you will see Access-Control-Allow-Origin http://localhost:3000, it means that only localhost:3000 is allowed, our fronted is hosted at this address, so e can try testing from there.
Add useSuccessStatus: 200 in the options to check the status


*Properly Applying Cors*

function options(req,res){let tmp; let origin = req.header("Origin) if(allowed.indexOf(origin) > -1){tmp ={origin:true, optionSuccessStatus:200}; else{tmp = {origin:false}}res(null,tmp)}}
Get the origin of request from the FE, and check whether it lies in the allowed array or nottt..
let allowed = ["http://localhost:3000","http://localhost:2005"];

*Routing Properly*

You can't create route for every /something in your server.js, it is unprofessional.
So create a folder called "routes" and then create .js files for each of the routes.

e.g. 

user.js
const express = require("express"); const router = express.Router();
router.get("/user", (req, res) => {  res.send("Welcome to user home");});
module.exports = router;

and in server.js
const userRoute = require("./routes/user");
app.use("/", userRoute);

and in Postman GET
http://localhost:8000/user

so you'll see Welcome to user home
